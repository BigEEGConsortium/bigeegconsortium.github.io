  "body": "### About\r\n\r\nThe goal of BigEEG Consortiumâ„¢ is to promote and facilitate large-scale analysis (e.g. meta-study) of EEG and other data modalities related to real-world neuroimaging. This is implemented through developing standards and tools for event tagging and meta-data encapsulation, along with providing publicly available standardized data.\r\n\r\n### Standards and Tools\r\n \r\nCurrently, there are two major standards being promoted by the consortium:\r\n\r\n#### Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) tags\r\n\r\nFor describing experimental and real-world events. For more information please visit www.hedtags.org\r\n\r\n#### EEG Experiment Schema (ESS)\r\n\r\nFor encapsulating EEG study meta-data. For more information please visit www.eegstudy.org\r\n\r\nFor list of studies currently available in ESS format please visit: www.studycatalog.org\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, we have released a standard EEG pre-processing toolbox for noisy channel detection and robust referencing, called PREP: http://vislab.github.io/EEG-Clean-Tools/\r\n\r\n![BigEEG Workflow](bigeegconsortium.github.io/Big EEG Workflow - Detailed.svg)\r\n",
